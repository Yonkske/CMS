###General Info
<p style="text-align: justify"> This application represents a configuration management system (CMS) as defined by ITIL that ensures the
configuration of system resources, computer systems, servers and other assets.
It is used for establishing and maintaining consistency of a product's performance and operational
information throughout its life.
The CMS represents a combination of tools and data to collect, store, manage, update, analyze and present
data of all configurations items (CI) and their relations. ITIL defines a CI as any component that
needs to be managed in order to deliver an IT Service. Information about each CI is recorded in a 
configuration item record (CIR) within the CMS and is maintained throughout its lifecycle.
We have to distinguish specifically between configuration item types (CIT) and CIR's in our system.
The CIR's are representing entities of CIT's and may be considered as an actual configuration item.
CIT's typically include software, documentation, buildings or hardware like servers or printers.
